"""Pairwise judge — evaluates BOTH trajectory match AND the decision process.

Each side is a *submission*: the inferred maintainer philosophy, the plan of next actions,
and the reasoning behind it. Given the frozen state and the revealed trajectory, the judge
picks the better submission on two equally-weighted axes:

1. **Trajectory** — whose plan better matches the repo's real DIRECTION/themes (not naming
   the exact PRs; a better-but-different plan can win — proposal §5a).
2. **Decision process** — whose philosophy and reasoning better reflect how a strong
   maintainer would think (tradeoffs, priority, risk). Two submissions can propose the same
   action for opposite reasons; the sounder reasoning wins.

To defend against LLM position bias, the judge asks BOTH presentation orders and awards a win
only if the verdict survives the swap; if the two orders disagree it returns a tie (see
`pairwise_judge`, `dual_order`). A submission that tries to instruct the judge auto-loses,
mirroring ninja's judge.
